YelpCamp is an application where users can sign up and login to add a new campground for rent.

The user can include the price of the campground per night, a description of the campground, comments from other users, and a name.

The user can edit his/her campground and comments but cannot edit other users campgrounds/comments.

The project has been deployed on heroku here: https://stark-hollows-32841.herokuapp.com/campgrounds/5a6ae2bb37233c2f68f50196

This is currently version12 (I have decided to not add previous versions on github because this version felt more complete in terms of functionality). I will be working on more features, and stylistic upgrades
